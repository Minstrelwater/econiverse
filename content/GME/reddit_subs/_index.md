"A foxhole for apes...but glorier!" This sub is a safe place for information ONLY. It is meant to be a smaller subâ€”for AMC/GME apes alike and whatever eventually comes afterâ€”that is less overwhelmed by chaos and noise than others. Think of it as an unofficial ape library. Remember those? Ideally, this sub will remain shill-free and and will also provide us with a solid, reliable place to share DD, research, news/media stories, and intel.
